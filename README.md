# Optimized CRC Incentives Project

This project aims to optimize colorectal cancer (CRC) screening incentives using Bayesian networks and various patient data. The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose.

## Directory Structure

- `models/`: Contains the Bayesian network models and related files.
- `outputs/`: Stores the output files generated by the project, including results and logs.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project, including scripts and modules.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optimized_crc_incentives.git
    cd optimized_crc_incentives
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Model

1. Ensure that the Bayesian network model files are in the `models/` directory.
2. Place the patient data CSV file in the `models/` directory.
3. Run the main script to process the data and generate results:
    ```sh
    python src/main.py
    ```

### Patient Data

Patient data is defined in the `patients.py` file located in the `tests/` directory. You can add or modify patient profiles as needed.

### Example Patient Profiles

Here are some example patient profiles defined in `patients.py`:

patient_1 = {
    "Age": "age_5_old_adult", 
    "Sex": "M",
    "SD": "SD_2_normal",
    "PA": "PA_2",
    "Smoking": "sm_1_not_smoker",
    "BMI": "bmi_2_normal",
    "Alcohol": "low",
    "Diabetes": "False",
    "Hypertension": "False",
}

patient_2 = {
    "Age": "age_4_adult", 
    "Sex": "M",
    "SD": "SD_2_normal",
    "PA": "PA_2",
    "Smoking": "sm_1_not_smoker",
    "BMI": "bmi_2_normal",
    "Alcohol": "low",
    "Diabetes": "True",
    "Hypertension": "True",
}

### Outputs
The results of the model runs are stored in the outputs/ directory. This includes logs, result files, and any other output generated by the scripts.
